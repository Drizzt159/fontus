Using Galileo board to monitor and water trees

Purpose
The purpose of this code is to allow an Intel Galileo board to monitor the moisture levels of tree, send and display this information, and water if available. This is a proof of concept at this point and will be tested for one tree.

The expected materials needed are the Galileo board, a water sensor, and possibly some LED lights for indicators, unless an App for Android or the cloud are used.
